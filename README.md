Project Overview 
Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a serious sleep disorder where the airway repeatedly becomes blocked during sleep, causing breathing interruptions and reduced oxygen levels. These episodes create distinct acoustic patterns, including irregular snoring, high-frequency gasps, and prolonged silences lasting over 10 seconds.
The goal of this project is to build an automated acoustic screening system that can differentiate between harmless snoring and apneic snoring that indicates potential OSA. By analyzing overnight audio recordings, the system will generate a preliminary risk assessment that could help identify individuals who should seek formal clinical evaluation.

Objectives

Primary Goal:
Develop a machine learning classifier capable of detecting apneic snoring events from audio recordings.

Additional Goals:
Identify breathing pauses exceeding 10 seconds in duration
Extract acoustic features associated with airway obstruction
Calculate a nightly OSA risk score based on detected events
Compare traditional machine learning approaches with deep learning methods
Create an interactive visualisation dashboard for results

Datasets
We're planning to work with  datasets:
Kaggle Snoring Dataset - Includes 500 snore samples and 500 non-snore samples for balanced training.

Project Timeline
Weeks 1-2: Dataset collection and preparation, feature extraction implementation.
Weeks 3-4: Model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.
Week 5: Risk scoring algorithm and visualisation dashboard development.
Week 6: Final testing, documentation, and presentation preparation.
